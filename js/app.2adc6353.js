It's been 30 years since the occupation of Earth by the Bactarans ended, and while the trade environment has made things easier, humanity still hasn't forgotten the crimes. The Earth Guard Force (EGF) is tasked with keeping an eye on the Bactarans. In 2095, a vessel was reported missing in the vicinity of a Bactaran mine on the small (6km wide) asteroid 951 Gaspra. Your ship, the EGF frigate Scythe, has been dispatched to investigate. In 2101, after years of fighting in the asteroid belt, the conflict is coming to a head at Ceres, where a Bactaran ship has blown through the blockade and must be stopped before it can make it to the warp bridge around Saturn.
