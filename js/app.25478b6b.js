Dream Askew gives us ruined buildings, ruined lives, ruined faces, loaded handguns, psychic powers, heartbroken underdogs and turbulent skies, asking \"What do you do next?\" Imagine that the apocalypse didn't happen everywhere at the same time. Instead, it happened in waves. It's still happening in waves. You were hit recently. You've fallen out of the society intact. You've found others who you can relate to, and you’ve banded together with them to form a queer enclave. Gangs roam the apocalyptic rubble, and scarcity is becoming the norm. And just beyond our everyday perception, howling and hungry, there exists a psychic maelstrom. Dream Askew is a game about post-apocalyptic lives. It’s a game that queers the post-apocalyptic genre, exploring how the apocalyptic process could impact our sexuality, genders, livelihoods, experiences of marginalization, and experiences of liberation.",presenters:"Eli Eaton",authors:"Buried Without Ceremony",start_time:"Sat, 24 Feb 2018 14:00:00 -0500",end_time:"Sat, 24 Feb 2018 18:00:00 -0500",tags:""},{code:"R327",title:"The Legends of Tamarra",system:"Beyonder: Science of the Six",description:"See R302.",presenters:"Jacob McEntire",authors:"Flying Nightbear Games",start_time:"Sat, 24 Feb 2018 14:00:00 -0500",end_time:"Sat, 24 Feb 2018 18:00:00 -0500",tags:""},{code:"R328",title:'The Sun, the Cave, and the Divided Line" by Aetherco/Dreamcatcher; presented by Chris Adams.
